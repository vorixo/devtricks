## Overview

## What is Splitgate?
Splitgate is a free-to-play, fast-paced multiplayer arena shooter that features player-controlled portals. 

The game features customizable loadouts, power-ups, power weapons and multiple competitive and casual gamemodes, along with advanced customization options for custom games. SPLITGATE: Arena reloaded also includes a Map Creator mode, allowing players to create their own maps and gameplay experiences.

### Going back to the origins
No heroes, no abilities, no limits. SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded combines the best of the original Splitgate and Splitgate 2.

## A technical challenge

SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded, makes use of state-of-the-art Unreal Engine technology, including world partition and Iris replication. 

This led us to extensively customize Unreal Engine's core systems to achieve better performance, as the game needs to run on both modern hardware and last-generation consoles.

My role in the development of Splitgate, among other responsibilities, revolves around the technical leadership of the Map Creator mode, enabling a fully networked building experience and allowing players to publish, manage and share their maps.

Modern versions of The Lab support prefabs, QOL building tools, environmental and placeable lighting, and material customization, between others. See [here](https://youtu.be/zN5410YsFsI).

In addition to The Lab, I was also responsible for animation programming, networked gameplay, AI navigation, player movement, optimization, and cosmetics.
