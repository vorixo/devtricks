## Overview

### Explore A Vast, Interconnected World
Journey across two expansive, parallel worlds in your epic quest to overthrow Adyr. While the living realm presents its own brutal challenges, untold terrors lurk in the nightmarish realm of the dead.

### Define Your Own Legend
Fully customise your characterâ€™s appearance from a wide array of visual options, before selecting one of nine character classes. Whichever starting path you take, develop your character to your own playstyle by upgrading stats, weapons, armour and spells.

### Master Fast, Challenging Fluid Tactical Combat
Only those that master the deep, tactical combat can hope to survive. Choose from 100s of uniquely brutal weapons, or forgo metal for magic with devastating attacks of the arcane.

### Unite or Fight in Online Multiplayer
Experience the expansive, single player campaign alone, or invite a second player to join your adventure in uninterrupted, online co-op. But be warned - heroes from other realms can, and will invade.

## An outstanding title

As Marek Tyminski (CEO [@CIGamesOfficial](https://twitter.com/CIGamesOfficial)) said, seeing this fresh and innovative take on the action-RPG achieve one million sales in just 10 days has been humbling for everybody at HEXWORKS and CI Games.

My role in the development of LOTF focused on the online aspects. Specifically, I worked on making sure that all the bosses and in-game ingredients were compatible with multiplayer gameplay. This included everything from AI, gates and traps to elevators. I also dedicated effort to optimizing the game's bandwidth usage for better performance.
