Hey devs! I'm Alvaro Jover-Alvarez, a '95 kid known as "vori" or "vorixo" in the Unreal Engine community.

I'm best at **networking** and **gameplay programming**, but I also enjoy other disciplines.

I love sharing knowledge about Game Development (also in [my blog](https://vorixo.github.io/devtricks/)), and I firmly believe that cultivating positive vibes, fostering teamwork, and providing great mentorship are essential for building a strong team.

My focus right now is programming using Unreal Engine 5 with specialized expertise in Unreal's **Gameplay Ability System** (GAS).

If you want to see what I'm doing, you can follow me [@vorixo](https://twitter.com/vorixo)
