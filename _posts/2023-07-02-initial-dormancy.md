This article is a collaboration with [WizardCell](https://twitter.com/wizardcells) and on it, you'll learn how `DORM_Initial` works and why you should be careful with it. 

# Introduction

If we read the description of the `DORM_Initial` dormancy setting, we see what follows: 
``` 
This actor is initially dormant for all connection if it was placed in map.
```

Which made me understand that this setting would work like `DORM_DormantAll` just with a couple extra optimizations. But it isn't the case, let's see what are the implications of using this setting.

# `DORM_DormantAll` versus `DORM_Initial`

When an Actor becomes relevant to a connection, all the properties of said Actor are sent to the connection, no matter whether the Actor is `DORM_DormantAll` or `DORM_Awake`. That means that the [state](https://vorixo.github.io/devtricks/stateful-events-multiplayer/) the client receives from the Actor will be consistent of what the server sees about it.

However, that is not the case of `DORM_Initial` Actors, as they will not send any C++ replicated property if a connection becomes relevant:

**Watch out!** Blueprint replicated properties ignore Actor dormancy settings.

## How to use `DORM_Initial`

So shall I simply not use `DORM_Initial`? No, you should! `DORM_Initial` Actors won't be considered for replication at all even under relevancy, and sometimes that can be a huge optimization.

To ensure incoming connections get the new values over `DORM_Initial` Actors, you should call `FlushNetDormancy` on them [before updating their properties](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/actor-network-dormancy-in-unreal-engine#whentousewakemethods). This will make the Actor to become `DORM_DormantAll` but only when strictly needed.

### What about calling `ForceNetUpdate` to also flush the dormancy?

Be very careful with this, as `ForceNetUpdate` also calls `FlushNetDormancy` but its guarded with a `NetDriver` check:

{% highlight c++ %}
void AActor::ForceNetUpdate()
{
	...

	if (GetLocalRole() == ROLE_Authority)
	{
		// ForceNetUpdate on the game net driver only if we are the authority...
		if (NetDriver && NetDriver->GetNetMode() < ENetMode::NM_Client) // ... and not a client
		{
			NetDriver->ForceNetUpdate(this);

			if (NetDormancy > DORM_Awake)
			{
				FlushNetDormancy();
			}
		}
	}

	...
}
{% endhighlight %}

So, if the `NetDriver` is Null at the moment you call `ForceNetUpdate`*, the Actor will never call `FlushNetDormancy`, causing it to stay in a `DORM_Initial` state. For that reason it is always recommended to **explicitly** call `FlushNetDormancy` when dealing with `DORM_Initial` Actors.

*Worlds don't get a `NetDriver` until [`UWorld::Listen`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/Engine/UWorld/Listen/) is called.
