Unreal Engine introduced Mover 2.0 in 5.4, this post showcases my first (second) impressions and an overview of the system.

# Introduction

Epic Games recently introduced a new and **experimental** Movement Component in 5.4, called Mover, so... let's take a look.

In order to activate the feature, open `Edit` and within `Plugins` windows, turn on the following:

![Mover Plugins]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}/assets/images/per-post/mover-show/mover-enable.jpg){: .align-center}

## How does it work?

The following video I've recorded showcases the state of the system at the release date of the Plugin during UE 5.4:

# Conclusion

Thanks for watching! 

Hopefully, and as I also said previously, I you are as hyped as I am with this new feature! :)
